<title lang="en">Bass Fishing with a Simple Walmart Bass Fishing Rod, Reel and Tackle Setup</title>
<desc lang="en">Need a quick and easy bass rod and reel setup? So did I! While out of town in Moultrie, Georgia for business, I forgot my bass rod and tackle at home, so I ran to the local Walmart and bought just what I needed for a great price. Walk with me as I pick out which bass fishing rod I prefer and why, than the lures I think would work best for bass while here in Moultrie, Georgia. 

After purchasing my bass fishing rod and bass tackle from Walmart for a great price, I head on over to a local pond near the hotel I am staying at in Moultrie, Georgia. I than set up my new Lew's Speed Stick rod by attaching the Abu Garcia reel I bought to it. Then I string my Spiderwire braided fishing line through my new pole and attach some 20 pound mono to the end. After that I tie a size 3/0 Mustad offset hook to my line, put on split slide weights, and I am ready for the lure! I bought two different types of rubber worms. Purple Powerbaits and Watermelon Yum Dingers.

I am ready to catch some bass! On Day 1, I used the Watermelon worms and caught three gorgeous Georgia Bass! On Day 2 I tried to switch up to the purple and didn't get a single hit. Switched back to the Watermelon worms and caught a bass almost instantly!

"We were invited by the owners of Conviction Outdoors to come hunt their gorgeous rolling hills on almost 200 acres of private family land. They stayed in the cabin on the property as well which was hand built by the owner himself. Absolutely gorgeous! We were so blessed to have had this opportunity and we enjoyed the property, food, and fellowship very much! To have been invited back was icing on the cake!"</desc>

<title lang="en">200 Disabled Veterans go Deep Sea Fishing in the Gulf!</title>
<desc lang="en">We were invited by Iron Men Outdoor Ministries to attend their Annual Deep Sea Fishing with Disabled Veterans trip. These two days consisted of a banquet to raise money and honor all of the disabled veterans that were invited on the fishing trip, as well as a day on the water, deep sea fishing on several boats! 

There ended up being 200 disabled veterans fishing! There were 20 total boats that took these men and women fishing! Three of these boats were 90 foot fishing charter vessels, and the rest were smaller charter boats. The total number of fish caught exceeded 2000! The total number of fish kept was about 1600! 

This entire trip was amazing to say the least! Being asked to film and collect content of what it is that Iron Men Ministries does, as well as to capture these disabled vets having a blast catching fish, was such an honor and so humbling! We are already counting down the days till the next one!

<desc lang="en">I seem to be getting a lot of related questions since the season ended – most about aches and pains in our four-footed hunting buddies. And us!

The difference is, dogs won't show it like we do, with gripes and limping, complaints and wincing. They are way too loyal and hard working. It's why we love 'em.

You might already know this, but veterinarians tell me dogs seldom show pain. What they do, is slow down. Their pace in the field drags, they're slow to get out of their crate. 
 
Maybe they won't jump onto your tailgate or training table.

That's probably arthritis, and it affects most dogs over eight years old. But here's the scary part: twenty percent of dogs show signs as early as one year old. 
 
In this video, I'll show you how to prevent arthritis, manage it if your dog already has it, and what to avoid so he doesn't get it prematurely!</desc>

<title lang="en">Fuel your bird dog's peak performance ... but NOT with carbs!</title>
<desc lang="en">We hunt to watch our dogs work. So, stand by for plenty of that. But first, let me relate my last season.  I tracked Flick's mileage. He averaged twenty-five miles a day, over almost fifty days in the field. I'm a lousy shooter, and okay trainer … so I'll attribute his stamina to my dumb luck, and his performance dog food.


If you want to watch your dog in the field day after day, heed some of the advice I got from Doctor Tim Hunt, a veterinarian, sled dog racer, and developer of the food Flick eats. He says the fuel you put in your dog directly impacts his ability to hunt hard, especially on a long hunting trip. He should know. His food has powered a bunch of Iditarod winners … and my guy Flick.


In this video, you'll learn what the key ingredients are in a dog food, how they work, and why. Hint: the most important component in your dog food is probably NOT what you think it is.</desc>

<title lang="en">Close Quarter Battle - S01:E05 - Delta Prison Rescue Operation</title>
<desc lang="en">In 1989, CIA operative Kurt Muse was imprisoned at the notorious Carcel Modelo in Panama for his role in organizing radio transmissions against dictator Manuel Noriega.

<title lang="en">Close Quarter Battle - S01:E07 - S.W.A.T.</title>
<desc lang="en">In 1968, a new form of military policing was being developed in a rural area north of Los Angeles. The Los Angeles Police Department sent an observer to this unit, and he, in turn, took this knowledge back to the LAPD. This contributed to the development of the department’s first Special Weapons and Tactics (S.W.A.T.) team. This CQB episode takes an historical journey to examine how this incident affected and changed police tactics around the world. Using CQB’s trademark “sub-second” analysis, the program also looks at how police S.W.A.T. teams train, plan and equip themselves for the challenges of urban combat. The dramatization of a 1980s S.W.A.T. siege of a gang safe-house demonstrates the complicated challenge of protecting innocent people who might be caught in the line of fi re, as well as the specifics of the squad’s training regimen, how they communicated, and the special equipment they used.</desc>

<desc lang="en">The Bosnian War was an extraordinarily complex event, with many layers of military involvement including NATO forces, national militaries, irregular paramilitary forces, mujahedeen revolutionaries, private security companies, and international intelligence personnel. One tactic in particular struck fear into the hearts of the military and civilians alike: the use of snipers positioned in high buildings. This edition of CQB investigates this specific combat technique and how it was countered by opposing forces.

<desc lang="en">In 1968, a new form of military policing was being developed in a rural area north of Los Angeles. The Los Angeles Police Department sent an observer to this unit, and he, in turn, took this knowledge back to the LAPD. This contributed to the development of the department’s first Special Weapons and Tactics (S.W.A.T.) team. This CQB episode takes an historical journey to examine how this incident affected and changed police tactics around the world. Using CQB’s trademark “sub-second” analysis, the program also looks at how police S.W.A.T. teams train, plan and equip themselves for the challenges of urban combat. The dramatization of a 1980s S.W.A.T. siege of a gang safe-house demonstrates the complicated challenge of protecting innocent people who might be caught in the line of fi re, as well as the specifics of the squad’s training regimen, how they communicated, and the special equipment they used.</desc>

He said, “As we leave the moon, we leave as we came and God willing as we shall return. ”But with Nasa relying on government funding, the path back to the moon has been full of obstacles.

<desc lang="en">A short documentary telling the story of Craig Jones' sudden rise to success after his upset victory over Leandro Lo at ADCC 2017. 
After his breakout performance at ADCC, Craig went on to beat many more big names such as Jake Shields In Polaris, and made it to the finals of EBI, where he had a close finals match against Gordon Ryan.
Since then Craig has competed in some of the biggest tournaments in the world and his life has changed dramatically. In this film we see that it wasn't always an easy road for him.

<title lang="en">Tap Out Challenge - Oceanside</title>
<desc lang="en">On October 15th at the picturesque Oceanside, CA, Charles Rials embarked on
an incredible BJJ journey, challenging strangers from all walks of life to tap me
out and claim $100. But there was a twist that none of them saw coming! Win or
Lose, they got the MONEY!!!
 What they all shared was the courage to step up, the passion to engage, and
the heart of a warrior. This video isn't just about BJJ or the challenge — it's a
celebration of the human spirit, perseverance, and the unexpected twists that
life (and jiu jitsu) can throw our way.
 Join Charles in this heartwarming, adrenaline-pumping journey where every
challenge was met with respect, and every challenger was met with a surprise.
Whether you're a BJJ enthusiast or someone who loves to witness genuine
human moments, this video has something special for you.</desc>

<desc lang="en">On October 15th at the picturesque Oceanside, CA, Charles Rials embarked on
an incredible BJJ journey, challenging strangers from all walks of life to tap me
out and claim $100. But there was a twist that none of them saw coming! Win or
Lose, they got the MONEY!!!
 What they all shared was the courage to step up, the passion to engage, and
the heart of a warrior. This video isn't just about BJJ or the challenge — it's a
celebration of the human spirit, perseverance, and the unexpected twists that
life (and jiu jitsu) can throw our way.
 Join Charles in this heartwarming, adrenaline-pumping journey where every
challenge was met with respect, and every challenger was met with a surprise.
Whether you're a BJJ enthusiast or someone who loves to witness genuine

Along with Lewis spewing his usual bile about the state of everything, Derek Edwards pontificates on his driving frustrations, Dom Irrera thinks alcohol is wonderful, Kathleen Madigan has lost all hope for America, Greg Giraldo rants on about how women have all the power today, and Paul F Tompkins has probably the most incendiary topic of all. You’d be an idiot to miss it… then again, that’s just our opinion.</desc>

Elsa kicks off the competition with a classic Kentucky breakfast, a recipe she learned from top Chef Ouita Michel at her Holly Hill Cooking Studio. Elsa wins the first point, but Kimberly’s ready to up the ante, whisking Elsa away for a thrilling cave kayaking adventure at the Gorge Underground. As they ride the chairlift to the top of the stunning Natural Bridge, the rivalry kicks into high gear and they go head-to-head in a trivia battle. The next surprise – a toast with Kentucky’s own Ale-8 soda , sourced by Kimberly straight from the factory only whets their whistles. At the Keeneland Racetrack they sip some spirit forward Keeneland Breezes while Elsa reveals all she has learned about racehorses from a visit to renowned trainer Mark Simms Jr. ‘s horse barn. A Betologist gives them a quick lesson on wagering and Kimberly’s horse wins the race.

The next surprise – a toast with Kentucky’s own Ale-8 soda , sourced by Kimberly straight from the factory only whets their whistles. At the Keeneland Racetrack they sip some spirit forward Keeneland Breezes while Elsa reveals all she has learned about racehorses from a visit to renowned trainer Mark Simms Jr. ‘s horse barn.
